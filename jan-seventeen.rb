#   p "Thats a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# num = gets.chomp

# 10.times do
#   puts num
# end

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# num = gets.chomp

# if num.to_i < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.
